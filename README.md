### Introduction

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

Here, we are able to bring the alive and interactive geomap to you that helps to visualize the Location, Magintude and Depth of each earthquake data.

### Instruction

Please find the following documents for better understanding:
1. [index.html](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/leaflet-challenge/blob/main/index.html)
    - This is the template that takes the codes from the **static** folder and display them into the geomap.
2. [style.css](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/leaflet-challenge/blob/main/static/css/style.css)
    - This file, work with the **index.html** file, designs the formats of the HTML template.
3. [logic.js](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/leaflet-challenge/blob/main/static/js/logic.js)
